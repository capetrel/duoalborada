    'welcome'   => "The Alborada Duo?

Another pair of guitars will you say?
Well no ! Stéphanie Faget and Olivier Castain, two musicians connected to each other by a specific theme, two personalities in search of a sound ideal with an unshakeable will, it is not so common. And when this choice concerns a part of the repertoire both well known and innovative there is something to surprise.
What is more marked than Spanish music, a territory so plowed? And yet the Duo Alborada succeeds in this feat of bringing to the guitar some musics which, while being in the beautiful tradition and the color of the eternal Spain, are at the same time totally creative: as for example the extracts of zarzuelas Belle-Epoque and Granados operas, such as Manuel de Falla's Second Spanish Dance, rarely performed on two guitars. Or as new pieces, some new, in the tradition of an expressionist flamenco, but reworked in the sense of modern classical music to make real concert works of the current music of the XXI century.
A strong and varied program, varied and demanding, to consume without moderation ...
Rafael Andia",
